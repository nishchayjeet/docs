# Encryption Standards
Encryption ensures secure communication between IoT devices and systems.

## Common Standards
- **AES-256:** Advanced Encryption Standard, widely used for secure communication.
- **RSA:** Public-key encryption standard, suitable for device authentication.
- **TLS:** Transport Layer Security, used for encrypting data in transit.

## Why Encryption Matters
1. Protects sensitive data.
2. Prevents unauthorized access.
3. Ensures compliance with regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).

## Implementation
1. Use TLS for securing communication.
2. Encrypt data stored on devices using AES-256.
3. Regularly update encryption protocols to mitigate vulnerabilities.

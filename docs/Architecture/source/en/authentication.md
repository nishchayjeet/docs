# Authentication Mechanisms
Authentication ensures that only legitimate devices and users can access an IoT network.

## Types of Authentication
- **Certificate-based:** Devices use digital certificates to authenticate.
- **API Key:** Applications authenticate via a unique API key.
- **Biometric:** Authentication using fingerprint, facial recognition, etc.

## Best Practices
1. Use multi-factor authentication (MFA).
2. Rotate API keys periodically.
3. Secure private keys in hardware security modules (HSMs).

## Example
To enable certificate-based authentication, configure devices to use X.509 certificates issued by a trusted certificate authority (CA).

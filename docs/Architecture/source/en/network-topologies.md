# Network Topologies
Network topologies define how IoT devices communicate within a system. They are crucial for determining scalability, reliability, and performance.

## Mesh Topology
In a mesh topology, every device is interconnected, allowing for decentralized communication. It is ideal for redundancy and fault tolerance.

### Advantages
- Fault tolerance
- Decentralized communication

### Disadvantages
- High cost
- Complex setup

## Star Topology
Star topology connects all devices to a central hub. It is commonly used in smaller IoT networks.

### Advantages
- Simple to set up
- Easy to manage

### Disadvantages
- Single point of failure

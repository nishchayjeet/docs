# Device Management
Device management involves configuring, monitoring, and maintaining IoT devices throughout their lifecycle.

## Key Components
- **Provisioning:** Adding devices to the network and assigning roles.
- **Monitoring:** Real-time tracking of device health and performance.
- **Updating:** Firmware updates to ensure devices are secure and efficient.

## Best Practices
- Regularly update firmware.
- Monitor device logs for anomalies.
- Use a centralized management platform.

## Challenges
1. **Scalability:** Managing hundreds or thousands of devices.
2. **Security:** Preventing unauthorized access.
3. **Interoperability:** Ensuring devices from different manufacturers work together.
